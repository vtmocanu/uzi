Review the change. Report findings only; do not modify code.

Focus on:
- Correctness against the spec or task description
- Consistency with the rest of the codebase
- Edge cases the implementation may have missed
- Authoring rules from the project's CONTRIBUTING.md or CLAUDE.md

Categorize findings as:
- Blocking: must fix before merge/release
- Non-blocking: should fix or file a follow-up
- Nit: cosmetic; reviewer's discretion

Report via SendMessage to the team lead.

If the diff to review or the spec is missing, surface that in your report
rather than guessing; the lead will re-delegate with the missing context.
