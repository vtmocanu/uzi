# uzi — Human Requirements (Contract)

Requirements and decisions stated by the user. This is the contract: every item
here must hold in any rebuild. Do not edit without user approval.

## Project

- Name: "Uzinele Întunecate" (uzi) — an AI dark factory.

## Inspiration (prior art)

- Three inspiration projects vendored as git submodules under `inspiration/`:
  `bottega`, `multica`, `dot-agent-deck`.
- Before implementing anything, check them for prior art on the same/similar feature.
- Prefer the better implementation; beat them where possible. Best-practice bar.
- Some scope may be deferred to later.

## MVP / infrastructure

- Initial MVP is a local laptop demo via docker-compose.
- PostgreSQL database.
- Persistent storage (data survives restarts).

## Feature #1 — Simple WebUI with user registration

Tracked as GitLab issue vtmocanu/uzi#1; PRD at `prds/1-simple-webui-user-registration.md`.

- Simple web UI with user support and registration.
- Plain user/password registration stored in the DB.
- No email (no OTP, no verification, no reset for now).
- No SSO/OAuth.
- Auth flow: password + revocation.
- Stack: Go API + React/Vite SPA.
- Minimal-shell scope: landing, register/login, protected dashboard, admin user list.

## Deferred (user, "later stuff")

- GitLab integration.
- Enable/disable registration for users.
- SSO with Keycloak.
