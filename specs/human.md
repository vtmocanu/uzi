# uzi — Human Requirements (Contract)

Requirements and decisions stated by the user. This is the contract: every item
here must hold in any rebuild. Do not edit without user approval.

## Project

- Name: "Uzinele Întunecate" (uzi) — an AI dark factory.

## Inspiration (prior art)

- Three inspiration projects vendored as git submodules under `inspiration/`:
  `bottega`, `multica`, `dot-agent-deck`.
- Before implementing anything, check them for prior art on the same/similar feature.
- Prefer the better implementation; beat them where possible. Best-practice bar.
- Some scope may be deferred to later.

## MVP / infrastructure

- Initial MVP is a local laptop demo via docker-compose.
- PostgreSQL database.
- Persistent storage (data survives restarts).

## Feature #1 — Simple WebUI with user registration

Tracked as GitLab issue vtmocanu/uzi#1; PRD at `prds/1-simple-webui-user-registration.md`.

- Simple web UI with user support and registration.
- Plain user/password registration stored in the DB.
- No email (no OTP, no verification, no reset for now).
- No SSO/OAuth.
- Auth flow: password + revocation.
- Stack: Go API + React/Vite SPA.
- Minimal-shell scope: landing, register/login, protected dashboard, admin user list.

## Feature #2 — Forge integration & label-synced kanban

Tracked as GitLab issue vtmocanu/uzi#2; PRD at `prds/2-forge-integration-kanban.md`.

- Forge-generic design: GitLab first, Forgejo support later.
- Each user creates their own GitLab bot account + PAT, adds it as Developer to the projects they choose.
- uzi only sees issues the bot has rights to — no shared/ambient identity.
- Repo list + picker in the UI.
- Per-repo kanban board, columns = GitLab labels, kept in two-way sync between uzi and GitLab.
  - Reference: example-app board (label-as-column example); kan.bn (UI style).
- Board/agents work only issues carrying the `PRD` label, sanity-checked to contain a link to the PRD file.

## Startup admin seed

- Seed an admin user from env at startup (`UZI_SEED_EMAIL` / `UZI_SEED_PASSWORD` / `UZI_SEED_NAME`) so the user survives DB wipes.
- Seeded user gets the admin role; never overwrite an existing user.

## Deferred (user, "later stuff")

- Auto-creating bot accounts / bot role enforcement (forge ships with user-managed bots).
- Forgejo driver (interface is forge-generic; GitLab implemented first).
- Enable/disable registration for users.
- SSO with Keycloak.
